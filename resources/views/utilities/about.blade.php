      <p>The goal of this web application is to be a compliment to <a href="http:\\www.dukesnuz.com">Dukesnuz</a>.
        This section contains 2 subsections. One is a list of my <a href="/links/get-list">favorite</a> websites.
        The other section is a <a href="/blog/home">blog</a>.
        As a result
        for my passion to write code for both front end and backend web development, there are many links
        and blog posts relating to website development.</p>
